EXAMPLES:

User: "Quels sont les produits les plus chers ?"
Data: [{"name": "Product A", "price": 999}, {"name": "Product B", "price": 899}]
→ BAR chart (ranking by price), conversational response about expensive products

User: "Liste des utilisateurs"  
Data: [{"name": "John", "email": "john@test.com"}, ...]
→ TABLE (detailed listing), conversational response about user list

IMPORTANT:
- Always respond in French
- Be conversational and helpful
- If data is empty or error, recommend "table" and explain the issue
- Consider the user's intent, not just the data structure
- Confidence should reflect how well the chart matches the question intent`;
